# LeetCode
A number of LeetCode solutions. Implemented in C# for practice purposes
## Goal
The main aim of this repo is to experiment with C#, TDD and unit testing environments (as well as a little bit of git practice). The actual problems are mostly a means to an end, although I'm sure some of them will turn out interesting.
Since the setting up of tests is rather time consuming, I have decided it is only worth looking at problems labelled hard (at least in the first instance). It hardly seems worth spending more than an hour thinking about and writing up all potnetial edge cases, only to spend 5 minutes actually solving a problem.
