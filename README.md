# LeetCode
A number of LeetCode solutions. Implemented in C# for practice purposes
## Goal
The main aim of this repo is to experiment with C#, TDD and unit testing environments (as well as a little bit of git practice). The actual problems are mostly a means to an end, although I'm sure some of them will turn out interesting.
